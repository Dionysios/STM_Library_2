DiscoveryBoard
==============================

This is a fork of ChibiOS/RT example project originally written by resset, available on GitHub (https://github.com/resset/STM32F4-Discovery-example-code/).

To compile the code, you need the GCC-ARM C-compiler. You get it from here for example:

http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~bergerc/msv/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_7-2013q1-20130313-linux.tar.bz2

Unpack the archive to: /opt

I added the code to read the accelerometer data as an example.

Adapted README
===============

This is my example code for the STM32F4 Discovers using the RTOS ChibiOS.

requirements
------------
* Chibios 2.5.0+ (or a recent development snapshot)
* arm toolchain (e.g. arm-none-eabi from summon-arm)

features
--------
* serial over USB console
* PWM initialization and control
* ADC measuring, continuous and single scan
* Accelerometer readings
* code structured into separate files

usage
-----
* PATH=$PATH:/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_7-2013q1/bin make
* connect the STM32F4 Discovery with both USB connectors
* flash the STM32F4 by using qstlink2, find the file build/ch.bin, and click on send
* use your favorite terminal programm to connect to the Serial Port (/dev/ttyACM0 for me, for example screen /dev/ttyACM0, probably COM1 on Windows)

console commands
----------------
* help
* exit
* info
* systime
* mem
* threads
* toggle 1/2/3/4 (toggles #led, short: t)
* blinkspeed #speed (changes blinker period to #speed ms, short: bs)
* cycle #duty (changes the duty cycle of PWM1 to #duty, short: c)
* ramp #from #to #step \[delay\] (creates a ramp for PWM1 with the given parameters, short: r)
* measure (measures 16384 analog samples on pin PC1 and prints the first and the average, short: m)
* measureAnalog (measures 16384 samples and converts the average to Volts, short: ma)
* measureDirect (measures 16384 samples and prints them all, short: md)
* measureContinuous (starts a background analog conversion, short: mc)
* readContinuousData (prints what has been collected by the background conversion, short: rd)
* stopContinuous (stops the analog conversion, short sc)
* printAccel (prints the current accelerometer data, short pa)





disclaimer
----------
Neither am I a good C programmer nor do I have extensive knowledge about 
ChibiOS, the STM32F4 or uCs in general. I wrote this code to make myself
familiar with the STM32F4 Discovery and I figured ChibiOS was a usefull tool.
From my POV the code is not that bad, but your opinion may differ. In
that case, please don't laugh at my code but provide constructive criticism.
I just realized: I'm no pro at Git, Github and Markdown either...

Since I started from the USB-CDC code example from ChibiOS which is GPLv3,
I think I am forced to release this code under GPLv3 though I don't care what you do
with the code. I asked Giovanni and he said "there is not much meat" in it anyways.
